# Tile-Trail

Tile Trail is a puzzle strategy game. Built using Node.js.

## Features

* A grid based puzzle game based in an icy tundra. The player must find a path through brittle tiles that cannot be stepped on twice. The objective is to collect enough food and reach the destination tile.
* A map builder that allows users to create and share their own puzzles.
* Server side validation of user submitted puzzles for validity. Additionally, server side profiling of submitted puzzles for the assignment of a difficulty metric.
